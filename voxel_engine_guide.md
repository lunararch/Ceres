## Key Design Principles

1. **Performance First**: Voxel engines are inherently demanding - optimize early
2. **Modular Architecture**: Keep systems decoupled for easier testing and modification
3. **Memory Conscious**: Large worlds require careful memory management
4. **Concurrent Design**: Leverage Go's goroutines for background processing
5. **Scalable World Size**: Design for potentially infinite worlds from the start

## Expected Timeline

- **Weeks 1-3**: Phases 1-4 (Foundation, basic 3D rendering, voxel basics, mesh generation)
- **Weeks 4-6**: Phases 5-6 (World generation and advanced rendering)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Phases 7-8 (Physics and performance optimization)
- **Weeks 9-10**: Phases 9-10 (Advanced features and tools)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Phases 11-12 (Networking and final polish)

This timeline assumes dedicated part-time work. Adjust based on your experience and available time.

## Performance Targets

- Render distance: 8-16 chunks (128-256 meters)
- Target FPS: 60+ on modern hardware
- Memory usage: <2GB for typical gameplay
- Chunk generation: <16ms per chunk on background thread

## Next Steps

Begin with Phase 1 and work systematically through each step. The voxel engine's complexity requires patience - don't skip steps or rush the foundation. Build small test worlds at each phase to validate your systems work correctly.

Consider creating a simple "tech demo" after Phase 4 to showcase basic voxel rendering, then expand it as you progress through subsequent phases.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Premature Optimization**: Get basic functionality working before optimizing
2. **Over-Engineering**: Start with simple solutions and refactor when needed
3. **Ignoring Memory Management**: Voxel engines can quickly consume massive amounts of RAM
4. **Skipping Profiling**: Always measure performance before and after optimizations
5. **Thread Safety Issues**: Be careful with concurrent access to chunk data

Remember: building a voxel engine is a marathon, not a sprint. Take time to understand each concept thoroughly, and don't hesitate to build small test applications along the way to validate your engine's design.
